# pokedex

>To see the source code go to 'main' branch. The 'gh-pages' branch is used for the deployment of the React app to github.

App created wanting to learn the implementation of APIs, React Router Dom and better understanding the workflow in React.

React Router is used to select pokemons and navigate throughout the site. The PokeApi is used for the full list of pokemons, another part of the PokeApi is used for the details and a separate API for the images. 


Tools I aquired during this project: 

  	-> Creating a search bar
    
    -> Using the Link hook from React Router
    
    -> Fetching and displaying data from APIs
    
    -> Creating a modal without the use of a state
